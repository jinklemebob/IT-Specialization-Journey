Hello, writing this after 3 months after the first note, honestly feel guilty about it but I try to really be consistent. Okay, during my time away, a lot of stuff happened, a lot of realizations, a lot of fuck ups. I realized a lot of important factors in my lifestyle that I must improve. Alright, I think I'm gonna treat this more than just how I learn and study about IT, I want to treat this also as a journal for my life's journey and everything that is in my mind I shall say it here. So regarding the time I spent away from this, to be honest it's more from inconsistency and the lack of curiosity, the lack of noting my progression in terms of knowledge and skill, and the lack of interest on doing those things. I believe that I've gone terribly soft, lazy, and ultimately tired like mentally and physically. I noticed it too late I believe, and now I think my grades and how I study has become inconsistent, there is a point where I'm doing well, but there's also a point where I fall short. And now I want to change my lifestyle, because I cannot allow myself to live like this while I'm still fairly young, cuz I'm literally bout to turn 20 in like a week. I believe that if I keep living this unbalanced, inconsistent, and tire-inducing lifestyle, future me wouldn't be able to keep up in the real world, in which it is soon to come. College ain't the real world yet, it's the trial of some sort, a test of might, persistence, and resilience. In the early years of College, like the first and this second year right now, we can afford to fuck up moderately big or small. But it's because of that reason I realized, I can't afford to fuck up this early and this much, because then it'll create a bad habit like taking it easy and lazy. No, in the real world, I believe shit gets real, no more baby steps and no more room for fuck ups. I want to teach that to myself early on, so I'd be able to have that 'stay hard, stay cool, dont work hard, work smart' mindset. I'm no where near that way of thinking, but I would do whatever it takes to attain that level of thinking. I've been watching these videos about 'lifestyle improvement' (I would call it), and other stuff like 'Things I Would Tell My Younger Self', 'Things I Should Do at MY 20s', basically videos on adulthood and making it big in the future. I'm gonna learn more about those things from here, and I've been starting to apply what I learned to my life and my mind, self-improvement from here on out, planning the next moves in the future, specializing my core skills and talent, so that I'd be able to become wealthy both financially and in life. Okay so moving on to the stuff we learned during my time off. in Data Structures and Algorithims, we learned from the introduction of DatStral and Linear Data Strucutres, to Trees and Hierchical Structures, and Heaps and Priority Queue. I'm gonna keep it short, cuz these midterms topic really unlocked a new level of logical thinking. I believe it gets progressive, it's becoming focused more on problem solving, and the best logic and conditions to apply. I realize that this is definitely a core skill that I would love to master because when you get a job as a software engineer or even hardware, I believe learning and mastering Data Structres and Algorithms apply to the general consensus of being an IT professional. I asked ChatGPT lmao, about that belief, and he 'absolutely' agrees on it. To be honest ChatGPT really been teaching me everything that I wanted to know, and my beliefs and way of thinking, this AI really fills in so much assurance by just being morbidly in-depth about my ideologies. Okay so going back, I believe that I should really lock in, in this subject and the other IT core-related stuff. Okay now, as for OOP, I believe that this is also essential for software programming. Cuz OOP is versatile and the concepts can be applied (I believe) to most programming languages. OOP is more about the code and syntaxes itself, but there still is a bunch of theoretical aspects in it like Encapsulation and Inheritance. I believe that learning about these concepts and way of strucutring codes and systems are important because learning about OOP, it really makes it easier to understand and modify certain stuff when you know about them. Like for the concept of procedural programming, it is how programming languages like Java (the one we're focused on) inherits its way of execution, it's top down. And for other concepts like Inheritance, Constructors, Encapsulation, I beleive these core OOP concepts apply and are essential in the industry (Job/Profession). When you know these core elements, programming, problem solving in systems, applying logic for better execution, structuring code that follows an organized and effective system, I believe that's some of the aspects of being an IT professional. Okay I got more to say but I think I'll just leave it here for now. I wanna plan more stuff in the future, and I WILL talk about them soon like my plans after graduating and how my skills have progressed. Until then, that's about it, see ya.
